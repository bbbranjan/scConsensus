Title: Combining supervised and supervised clustering of scRNA-seq data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bobby Ranjan
Maintainer: Bobby Ranjan <ranjanb@gis.a-star.edu.sg>
Description: scConsensus consolidates two complementary clustering results to leverage the information from both. It creates a contingency table to allow the user to manually or automatically combine clustering results. This consensus set of cluster labels is then refined by re-clustering the cells on differentially expressed genes between the merged clusters.
